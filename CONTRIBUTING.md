# Contributing

**This project is NOT accepting contributions.**

This is a production tool hosted at [davidtiong.com](https://davidtiong.com) and maintained solely by the site owner for security and liability reasons.

## Why No Contributions?

1. **Security**: As a free tool processing personal data (names, emails, phone numbers, photos), we maintain strict control over the codebase to ensure user privacy and security.

2. **Liability**: All code is personally vetted and maintained by the site owner. We cannot accept external code that could introduce security vulnerabilities or privacy issues.

3. **Support Commitment**: We cannot commit to reviewing, testing, and merging external contributions while maintaining the quality and security standards required for a production tool.

## Found a Bug or Security Issue?

If you discover a bug or security vulnerability, please report it privately via email:

**Email**: david@davidtiong.com

Please do NOT open public GitHub issues, as this repository has issues disabled.

## Want to Use This Code?

The code is open source and publicly available for **transparency and learning purposes**:

- ✅ You can view the code to verify our privacy and security claims
- ✅ You can learn from the implementation
- ✅ You can fork it for your own **private use**

However, please note:
- ⚠️ Do not host competing public instances
- ⚠️ The official, maintained version is only at davidtiong.com
- ⚠️ Pull requests will not be reviewed or merged

## Transparency

This repository is public so users can:
- Verify that we don't track or store their personal information
