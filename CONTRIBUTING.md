# Contributing

**This project is NOT accepting code contributions.**

This is a production tool hosted at [davidtiong.com](https://davidtiong.com) and maintained solely by the site owner for security and liability reasons.

## Why No Code Contributions?

1. **Security**: As a free tool processing personal data (names, emails, phone numbers, photos), we maintain strict control over the codebase to ensure user privacy and security.

2. **Liability**: All code is personally vetted and maintained by the site owner. We cannot accept external code that could introduce security vulnerabilities or privacy issues.

3. **Support Commitment**: We cannot commit to reviewing, testing, and merging external contributions while maintaining the quality and security standards required for a production tool.
